Configure 2 machines as http servers. Make sure the http service is running. Create an index.html page that 
displays the IP address of that machine. Open port 80 in the firewall. Disable SELINUX.

Configure the 3rd machine as the reverse proxy using nginx.  Disbale SELINUX.

When the users access http://reverse-proxy-nat-ip  then the 1st client website should open. 
When the users access http://reverse-proxy-nat-ip/pune then the 2nd client website should open.

Now test using curl.

Now configure nginx as load balancer.
When the users access http://reverse-proxy-nat-ip multiple times then each time the webpage should be different.

Check with curl.

Now add weight as 7 to the first server.
Check if 7 requests go to the first server.
