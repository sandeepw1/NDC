Suppose we want to prevent potential brute force attempts to guess valid username and password combinations for the Secure Shell (SSH) service.

In this scenario, we can use packet rate limiting rules to limit the number of connections to the SSH port from the same IP address. Let’s use the following iptables commands to achieve this:


iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 120 --hitcount 10 -j DROP


The above commands use the iptables extension recent, which allows us to dynamically create a list of IP addresses and match against them in different ways. In this example, we instruct iptables to drop connections from any IP address if it attempts to open more than 10 connections to the SSH port (22/tcp) within 120 seconds (two minutes).
By using the NEW state, only new connections are impacted by this rule, not established ones.

Allowing Established and Related Incoming Connections

sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

Dropping Invalid Packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

Blocking an IP Address
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 203.0.113.51 -j DROP

limit
This module must be explicitly specified with `-m limit’ or `–match limit’. It is used to restrict the rate of matches, such as for suppressing log messages. It will only match a given number of times per second (by default 3 matches per hour, with a burst of 5). It takes two optional arguments:
–limit
followed by a number; specifies the maximum average number of matches to allow per second. The number can specify units explicitly, using `/second’, `/minute’, `/hour’ or `/day’, or parts of them (so `5/second’ is the same as `5/s’).
–limit-burst
followed by a number, indicating the maximum burst before the above limit kicks in.

Syn-flood protection:

# iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
Furtive port scanner:

# iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST RST \
-m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
Ping of death:

# iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit \
--limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
